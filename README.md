Students are evaluated on comprehension of the lesson and signs of stress. These factors cater to the students at Prep for Prep's IFE program,
an intensive summer entrepreneurship and tech camp where groups of students pitch a complete tech product or business incorporating tech
to panelists (executives at Google and successful small business owners).
