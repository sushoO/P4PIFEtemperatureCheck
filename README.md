The Temperature Check is a teacher tool created to streamline the process of gathering student feedback. 

Students are evaluated on their comprehension of the lesson and for any signs of stress. These factors cater to the students at Prep for Prep's IFE program,
an intensive summer entrepreneurship and tech camp that will have groups of students pitch a completely fledged out tech product or business incorporating tech
to panelists that include executives at Google as well as successful small business owners.
